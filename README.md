Completed in one day for ludum dare 52, first attempt of using monogame

## Things I would add if I had more time
- Refactor the code to use classes for the sprites. - done
- Add in an opening screen with click to play and controls.
- Add in animations for the sprite.
- Add in background music and music for getting hit, maybe make the music speed up.
- Change the movement for the grim reapers and add in more as the game goes on.
- Add in some more interactivity, maybe a farmer fork prod or a gun.
- Make sprites solid so they bounce off each other rather than going through each other.
- Make collisions more accurate based on pixels rather than boxes.
