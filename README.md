## Things I would add if I had more time
Refactor the code to use classes for the sprites.\n
Add in an opening screen with click to play and controls.\n
Add in animations for the sprite.\n
Add in background music and music for getting hit, maybe make the music speed up.\n
Change the movement for the grim reapers and add in more as the game goes on.\n
Add in some more interactivity, maybe a farmer fork prod or a gun.\n
Make sprites solid so they bounce off each other rather than going through each other.\n
Make collisions more accurate based on pixels rather than boxes.\n
